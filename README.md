# Data-Science-Hub-Exploring-Insights-through-Analytics-Projects
Welcome to my repository showcasing a variety of Python-based data analytics projects. Each project highlights different data analysis skills, all crafted using Python. From visualization to machine learning, explore various domains and methodologies, honing your data science expertise while uncovering valuable insights.

### Projects
#### Project 1

An international air service provider is expanding into North American aviation market. The company's primary business objective is to maximize profitability while maintaining punctuality as a core aspect of its brand identity. The overarching goal of this project is to utilize data from over 1 million flights to recommend the most profitable routes using various analytical techniques.

#### Project 2

A social media company requires a machine learning model to differentiate between videos presenting factual claims and those expressing opinions. This model will streamline user report handling, reducing backlog, and enabling efficient prioritization. Techniques such as XGBoost, Random Forest, and Natural Language Processing will be explored to extract relevant variables from text files.
